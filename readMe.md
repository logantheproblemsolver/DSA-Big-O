1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

                The BigO notation complexity of this one is O(1)


2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

                The BigO notation complexity of this one is O(n) 


3. Are you here?
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function areYouHere(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        const el1 = arr1[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const el2 = arr2[j];
            if (el1 === el2) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
                This is a nested function, which means that the complexity of this one is O(n^k) 


4. Doubler
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}

                This function takes whatever is in the array and doubles it (one by one), so therefore it's depending on how big the array size is which means the complexity is O(n) 


5. Naive search
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}

                This function is looking at every value in the array and checking to see if it matches the item variable. The complexity would be O(n) again because it'll be slower depending on how big the array is.


6. Creating pairs:
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function createPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i] + ", " +  arr[j] );
        }
    }
}
                This function is nesting through the array and then nesting through the array again, and it reiterates through the array the second time until the first iteration is complete. So the complexity would be O(2^n)


7. Compute the sequence
What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i == 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

                This function is the fibonacci sequence, and gives you the whole sequence up until the number given. This complexity is O(n)
